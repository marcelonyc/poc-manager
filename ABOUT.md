# About POC Manager

POC Manager is not a commercial project. I built it out of my own experience as a Sales Engineer — after running countless Proofs of Concept and realizing there had to be a simpler, cleaner way to keep everything organized.

This is a project I created because I needed it myself, and I believe other Sales Engineers might find it just as useful. It's something I care about improving over time, based on real-world use and practical feedback.

## How to Access POC Manager

You're welcome to clone the GitHub repository and run it on your own infrastructure:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/marcelonyc/poc-manager)

Or you can use my hosted deployment:
- [Hosted Instance](https://pocmanager.marcelonyc.com/app)

## Free to use

I don't charge for access to the SaaS instance. Down the road, I may ask for voluntary donations to help cover infrastructure costs and improve availability — but there's no intention to turn this into a commercial product.

## Service Availability Commitment

For the hosted instance, I currently commit to:

- **7-day Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: Maximum time to restore service after an outage
- **24-hour Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: Maximum acceptable data loss measured in time

As the user base grows, I hope to improve these targets and make the service more resilient.

## Philosophy

POC Manager is built by a Sales Engineer, for Sales Engineers. If it helps you run better POCs, then it's doing exactly what I intended.
