# Accessing Public POCs

If you've received a public link to a POC, this guide explains how to access and view it.

## What is a Public POC Link?

A public link is a secure URL that allows you to view a specific POC without needing to create an account or log in. It's shared by your Tenant Admin or the organization managing the POC.

**Example link format:**
```
https://poc-manager.example.com/share/rA5k_xY2pQ8jM1nL_Z9vW4bK3tH6cJ0
```
