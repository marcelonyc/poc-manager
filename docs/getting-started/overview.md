# Overview

## What is POC Manager?

POC Manager is a comprehensive platform designed to streamline Proof of Concept (POC) engagements between vendors and customers. It provides a structured approach to managing POC projects with clear objectives, tasks, and success criteria.

## Core Concepts

### POCs (Proof of Concepts)
A POC is a time-bound engagement where a vendor demonstrates their product or solution to a potential customer. Each POC includes:

- **Basic Information**: Title, description, customer company, dates
- **Objectives**: Clear goals for the engagement
- **Tasks & Task Groups**: Structured activities to complete
- **Success Criteria**: Measurable outcomes
- **Resources**: Supporting materials and documentation

### Tenants
A tenant represents an organization using POC Manager. Each tenant has:

- Isolated data and users
- Custom branding (logo, colors)
- Independent configuration
- Separate billing (if applicable)

### Users & Roles
POC Manager uses a role-based access control system with five distinct roles:

1. **Platform Admin**: Manages the entire platform
2. **Tenant Admin**: Manages a specific tenant
3. **Administrator**: Creates POC templates
4. **Sales Engineer**: Manages POC engagements
5. **Customer**: Participates in POCs
